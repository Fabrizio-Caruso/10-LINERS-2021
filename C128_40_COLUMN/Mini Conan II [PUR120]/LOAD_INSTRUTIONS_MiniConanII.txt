Just use any C128 emulator such as Vice or Z64K and either use the .prg or .D64 file.
You can load the game into a real C128 by using many methods such as an SD2IEC card reader to load the .PRG or .D64 file.

Remark: The game is meant for the 40 column screen (VIC-IIe) but might work in 80 column mode (VDC) as well.

You can also load the .bas file through CBM Prg Studio and Vice.

You may have to type RUN to start the game.
