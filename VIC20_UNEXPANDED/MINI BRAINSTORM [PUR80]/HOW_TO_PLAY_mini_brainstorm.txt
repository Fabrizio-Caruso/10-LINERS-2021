MINI BRAINSTORM

This is the old mini puzzle "Missionaries and Cannibals".
The name "Mini Brainstorm" comes from "Brainstorm", which is a Vic 20 port of "Missionaries and Cannibals".

GOAL:
On the left bank of the river you have 3 missionaries (clubs character) and 3 cannibals (red bullet character).
The boat can take 1 or 2 people. The boat needs at least 1 person to cross the river.
Cannibals eat missionaries on the same bank if they are the majority.
You can only cross the river from bank A to bank B if the boat is already on the bank A.

CONTROLS:
Enter either one single letter (A B C D E F) or a combination of them and press <return>.

Example 1:
At game start, DE<return> -> move cannibals D and E to the right bank

Example 2:
